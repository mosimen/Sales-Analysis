# Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL: Project Overview 

In this project I performed exploratory data analysis of Retail sales data using SQL.
Customer segmentation was also carried out using RFM and Cohort techniques to understand the purchasing pattern of our customers and increase retention rate.

## Importance of Customer segmentation in sales analysis
Customer segmentation involves breaking down customers into groups to better understand them.
With this technique we can identify customers that are loyal, active or on the verge of churning. This enables the sales team to convert more leads, increase retention rate and generate moe revenue.

### RFM Technique

RFM is one of the tools that is used in segmentation analysis.
It is an indexing technique that uses past purchase behaviour to segment customers.

RFM uses 3 key metrics;
- Recency - Last order date (how long ago was their last purchase)
- Frequency - Count of Total Order (how often did they purchase)
- Monetary value - Total spend (how much they spent)

# Business Questions/EDA
#### Total sales per year
#### Revenue by customer
#### Which product category generated more revenue
#### Which year generated the highest revenue
#### What was the best month for sales in 2019? How much was earned that month
#### What type of product did they order frequently that month
#### What colour of product did people order most
#### Which country has the highest number of customers that are no longer active
#### Which country has the highest number of customers that are slipping way?

##### - These questions were answered in the SQL EDA and Tableau Analysis

In this project I performed exploratory data analysis of Retail sales data using SQL.
Customer segmentation was also carried out using RFM technique to understand the purchasing pattern of our customers and increase retention rate.


## Business Questions

#### Total sales per year

#### Which productline is generating more revenue

#### Which year generated the highest revenue

#### Which productline generated the highest revenue and in what year

#### Which dealsize is generating more Revenue

#### What was the best month for sales in a specific year? How much was earned that month

#### What type of product did they order frequently in November

#### Who are our best customers, who are the potential churners

##### These questions were answered in the EDA and Tableau Analysis
